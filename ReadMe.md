**_Holy Bible: American King James Version_** (AKJV) was produced by Peter Engelbrite with assistance from Tye Rausch and Eve Engelbrite.

To report errors use issues here in this project. 

The *American King James Version* is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original *King James Version* This translation of the Bible combines the integrity of the *Authorized King James Version* with the readability of Modern English. The *American King James Version* accomplishes this by substituting archaic words with modern words, word for word.

The *American King James Version* replaces archaic Middle English words with Modern English words without changing the grammar or sentence structure of the *King James Version.* Care has been taken to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. A word substitution list is included.

You can trust this translation as you trust the original that King James authorized, but now you can read it in the language you actually speak.

A special thanks to Tye Rausch and Eve Engelbrite who helped tremendously on this project.
